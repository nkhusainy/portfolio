## Favorite Equation

I would not say this is my *favorite* equation, per se... However, this did stick with me as Herbert told us to memorize this equation:

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{1}{2}(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma})^2}
$$

This is the general form of the probability density function of a **normal distribution**.

## A little info...

I do not have one favorite movie of all time. But I can compile a top 3, and those are:

-   Pride and Prejudice (2005)

-   Flipped (2010)

-   Legally Blonde (2001)
